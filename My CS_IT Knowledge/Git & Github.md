The best part about this project was learning how to commit meaningfully.

See image below to understand how commiting meaninfully appears.

I used the types for each commit. In the previous cases it was page features being added but in this case the README was updated.

The changes were made, `git add --all` was done, and `git commit` was pressed which lead to VIM as default editor.

> Note that to allow the use of VIM through terminal of VSCodium, git --global config core.editor "vim" had to be used.
